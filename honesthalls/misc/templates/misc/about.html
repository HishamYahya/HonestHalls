  <h2>About HonestHalls</h2>
  <hr />
  <span class="ethos-text">HonestHalls was developed by a group of seven students as our first year Computer Science project. We decided on HonestHalls for our project because, after much discussion, many of us felt the same frustrations regarding the choosing of our first year accomodation.
  <br>
  As University of Manchester students, we all agreed that the official website was severely lacking, with few pictures, inconsistent data and no reviews. Reviews found elsewhere online were often out of date by several years and of a low quality.
  <br>
  Your first year accomodation has a huge impact on your university experience, setting up friendships that will last years. And yet deciding on first year accomodation can often feel more like a gamble than a well-informed choice.
  <br>
  This is what we hope to change.
